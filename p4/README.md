<h1>p4: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data</h1>

This project is from the [Data Wrangling](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032) course. The original OSM data that was used for munging was a custom area of Atlanta, GA provided by [MapZen](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/). The input folder contains a sample that was created using the <b>create_sample.py</b> script.
