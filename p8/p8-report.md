## 2. Summary

In this dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales), video game sales from 1980 to 2016 were examined. The title and its information such as release year, genre, platform, publisher, and ranking were also given. The goal of this exploration is to explore the <b>highest selling titles</b> through those relative information.

## 3. Design

### * Selection

For the initial design, I decided to broadly introduce the data and which I believed a line graph would permit. The line graph would display the progression of global sales of video games throughout the years. I implemented dashboards throughout the story as well. The dashboards consist of a bargraphs and text tables which users can interact with to get more information such as the titles of a certain platform or genre.

### * Visualization Changes

In terms of visualization changes, I initially focused on the title's platform when I was trying to examine the highest grossing titles. However I decided to focus particularly on the publishers because it relayed more interesting information such as <b>Nintendo</b> having multiple titles with the highest rankings in overall sales.

In my initial visualization, my story consisted of multiple dashboards. After feedback, I realized that the story became <b>noisy</b> with various sheets conveying unrelated information. The one dashboard that required to be replaced was the one with Nintendo's Wii and DS being discussed.

## 4. Feedback
<br>
<li type='square'> The first revision of the visualization included 10 highest grossing titles. The responder suggested to remove it after being seen unneccessary to the story being said (Nintendo's success in 2008). In addition, the responder was not sure what it was actually being said since there was no title.</li>
<br>
<li type='square'>The responder also commented on <b>focusing</b> on Nintendo's Wii and DS place rather than interacting with the data. I decided to convert it to a sheet focusing solely on the placement.</li>
